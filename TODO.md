# Features to Implement
## UnWordle
- add juice
- when the player solves the word, show a dialog to let them know there is nothing else to do; remove when new word is available
- instead of showing an alert when the player has finished the puzzle, show a custom dialog instead
## Solver
- specify where in the word the letter is contained
- recommended guesses? words that don;t have duplicate letters?

# Bugs to fix
- duplicated elements in array when setting disabled keys (low)
- handle multiples of a letter when there is only one letter valid in the word (high)
- fix screen height to be more responsive (solved?)
